## Features

### Intuitive, Easy, and Safe
TomoWallet offers a simple, and intuitive mobile interface allowing users to securely store, send, and receive $TOMO and all tokens issued on TomoChain. You could trace transaction history easily on TomoWallet.

### Built in governance
TomoWallet serves as a practical mobile utility which allows stakeholders to vote for masternodes and the governance system. This is a very useful feature as the voting and governance system become an active and crucial part of TomoChain

### Reward tracking
Understanding users’ experience with TomoChain’s staking and incentive system, TomoWallet helps users to easily track their relevant rewards earned from staking and masternode running in real-time. Therefore, a user can efficiently manage the earnings to maximize the profit

### D-App Browser Integration
DApp-browser bridges the gap between TomoWallet and DApp. DApp browser on TomoWallet allows token holders to play all dApps and games that are deployed on TomoChain. This is part of our contribution to provisioning a great user experience on mobile in the path towards blockchain mass adoption.
